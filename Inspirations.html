  <h1>Inspirational Quotes by Paulo Coelho</h1>
  <em><p>The Journey isn't so much about becoming anything.<br />
    It's about unbecoming everything that isn't really you.</p>
    <p>
      Before a new chapter is begun, the old one has to be finished:<br />
      Tell yourself that what has passed will never come back.</p></em>
